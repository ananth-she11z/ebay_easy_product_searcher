Both EXE and Python Code Available to get used ;)

NOTE: For using Python code directly please ensure you install requests and beautifulsoup4 modules using pip or pip3. You can use both Python2 or Python3.


This tool will take three arguments from user 1. Product name 2. Number of pages to scrap 3. Your budget (Not to worry about currency, the code knows everything ;) ) and works to give you a detailed CSV output with all required details based on the details you provide.

To get help menu just run the binary via cmd with no arguments:

Usage: she11zebay.exe <Product name> <No. of pages to scrap> <Budget price>

Example: she11zebay.exe "Mens watches" 1 50
Example: she11zebay.exe Laptops 3 500


Enjoy!! This tool works best for lazy people.

NOTE: As this is a python code converted to EXE using Pyinstaller. This binary usualy triggers AV. Please either disable AV or add an exception before download and use.
